Future plans:
enforcing div(n) = 0 for Neumann boundary conditions
- in 2D,  all terms of div(n) should be 0 (does not work in 3D)
- in order to implement this, we should keep the clamping for overflowing array cells and anytime there's a D_j n_j term, 
we should set the entire array to be 0 on the boundary
